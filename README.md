# Modding-in-MC-week1

Hello Ninjas and their families!
Thank you so much for such an incredible week of coding and playing Minecraft. Here is the hub for each and every one of your mods. 

  Each Ninja should find two files here for them to download along with the download instructions. The .ZIP file is used in Mcreator so that Ninjas can continue to edit and develope their mods now that camp is over. The .JAR file is the mod itself which can be added to your game through the use of Curseforge.

  I truly hope these instructions are helpful in the quest to access these mods at home. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have issues accessing them. These Ninjas worked very hard and deserve to enjoy their creations long after this camp has ended.

  Thank you all so much for such an incredible camp. It has been amazing to be your Sensei and I cannot be more proud of all the work you've done. Now go forth and play!
