# Modding-in-MC-week1

Hello Ninjas and their families!
Thank you so much for such an incredible week of coding and playing Minecraft. Here is the hub for each and every one of your mods. 

  Each Ninja should find two files here for them to download along with the download instructions. The .ZIP file is used in Mcreator so that Ninjas can continue to edit and develope their mods now that camp is over. The .JAR file is the mod itself which can be added to your game through the use of Curseforge.

  I truly hope these instructions are helpful in the quest to access these mods at home. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have issues accessing them. These Ninjas worked very hard and deserve to enjoy their creations long after this camp has ended.

  Thank you all so much for such an incredible camp. It has been amazing to be your Sensei and I cannot be more proud of all the work you've done. Now go forth and play!

# How to open your workspace into and install MCreator
	For further editing and adding to your mods you’ll have to recreate your workspace at home - here is how!
Download the Ninja’s ZIP folder from the Github

After it has been installed, extract your workspace zip file into a folder on your desktop, 

 Download MCreator from this link: https://mcreator.net/download
 
 After downloading, run the file and follow the installation steps.
 
 Run the MCreator workspace file present in the folder after it has been extracted
 
 MCreator should start automatically loading your workspace now
 
# How to install your mod into Minecraft
Download the [name].jar file from GitHub
Go to https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/ and find the version that your mod was created in. [Typically use 1.20.6] (You will be prompted with an ad upon clicking on download, you should click on the top right after a few seconds to skip.)

 Run the file you downloaded and follow the steps it provides and click install client, then click OK. (If you are unable to run the file, follow the Install Java steps.)
Open Curseforge and open the Minecraft Menu

Create a Custom Profile,be sure to set the Minecraft Version to 1.20.1

Once the profile has been installed, hit the 3 dots and navigate to mod folder and wait for the files to open

Drag the .jar file into the folder titled mods then close the file window

Now, Ninjas should be able to launch their modded Minecraft game through the CurseForge profile. After a moment it will launch the Minecraft Launcher and at the top the option to launch with their mod should be present.
